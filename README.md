# ðŸŽ¨ Pigmnts
Pigmnts is a color palette generator built using Rust, compiled to WebAssembly. This allows for super-fast color palette extraction from an image on the web. It uses the [K-means++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means%2B%2B) clustering algorithm to select the most commonly occuring colors from the image.

## Functions
Pigmnts exposes following function in WebAssembly
### pigments(c: `HtmlCanvasElement`, num_colors: `u8`)
> Returns an array of **[8-digit Hex](https://css-tricks.com/8-digit-hex-codes/) color codes** as strings found in the image. Eg. ["#6DDAD0FF", "#FF3A940A"]

A `<canvas>` element is passed as one of the arguments which has the image to be processed. Internally, the pixel data is taken from the canvas, and then clustered to create the color palette.
`num_colors` defines the number of colors to be gathered from the image.

If this crate is used in some Rust projects, then following function is also available
### pigments_pixels(pixels: `&Vec<RGBA>`, num_colors: `u8`)
> Returns an array of **[8-digit Hex](https://css-tricks.com/8-digit-hex-codes/) color codes** as strings found in the image. Eg. ["#6DDAD0FF", "#FF3A940A"]

This function takes a reference to a Vector of `RGBA` which contains the color data, and `num_colors` to limit the number of colors found. This function can be used when color data is gathered from an image decoded using [image-rs](https://github.com/image-rs/image).  
**NOTE**: The `RGBA` struct is different from implementations in other crates such as image-rs.
